            Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an
            American entrepreneur, industrial designer, business magnate, media
            proprietor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO
            of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member
            of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its
            acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He
            is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer
            revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business
            partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and
            German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs
            attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In
            1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment and studying
            Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell
            Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame
            and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II,
            one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
            Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which
            was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led
            to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed
            by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced
            computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing
            industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the
            first laser printer to feature vector graphics.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle
            with the company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same
            year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a
            computer platform development company that specialized in computers
            for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to
            develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer
            graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new
            company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated
            feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major
            animation studio, producing over 25 films since.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's
            acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple,
            which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with English
            designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger
            cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think different"
            advertising campaign and leading to the Apple Store, App Store
            (iOS), iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, and iTunes Store. In 2001,
            the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X
            (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the
            operating system a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time.
            In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.
            He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor on October 5,
            2011, at the age of 56. In 2022, he was posthumously awarded the
            Presidential Medal of Freedom.

            Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February
            24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali (Arabic:
            عبد الفتاح الجندلي).[2] His cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly, maintains
            that his birth name was Abdul Lateef Jandali.[3] He was adopted by
            Clara (née Hagopian) and Paul Reinhold Jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Abdulfattah "John" Jandali was born and raised in an Arab Muslim
            household in Homs, Syria. As an undergraduate at the American
            University of Beirut in Lebanon, he was a student activist and was
            imprisoned for his political activities.[4] He pursued a PhD at the
            University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Schieble, an American
            Catholic of German and Swiss descent.[4][5] Both of the same age,
            Jandali was a doctoral candidate and a teaching assistant for a
            course Schieble was taking.[6] Novelist Mona Simpson, Jobs's
            biological sister, noted that Schieble's Catholic parents were
            unhappy that their daughter was with a Muslim.[7] Jobs's biographer
            Walter Isaacson states that Schieble's dying father "threatened to
            disown her if she wed Abdulfattah",[6] so they remained an unmarried
            couple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul Jobs was a Coast Guard mechanic.[8] After leaving the Coast
            Guard, he married Clara Hagopian, an American of Armenian descent,
            in 1946.[9] An ectopic pregnancy led them to consider adoption in
            1955.[8][9][10] Hagopian's parents were survivors of the Armenian
            genocide.

            Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali
            spent the summer with his family in Homs. According to Jandali,
            Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: "Without
            telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have
            the baby without anyone knowing, including me."
          </p>
          <p>
            Schieble gave birth to Jobs in San Francisco on February 24, 1955,
            and chose an adoptive couple for him that was "Catholic,
            well-educated, and wealthy",[14][15] but the couple later changed
            their minds.[14] He was then placed with Paul and Clara Jobs, who
            lacked wealth and college education, and Schieble refused to sign
            the adoption papers.[16] She asked the court to find a different
            family,[14] but consented when Paul and Clara pledged to fund his
            college education.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his youth, his parents took him to a Lutheran church.[18] When he
            was in high school, Clara admitted to his girlfriend, Chrisann
            Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first
            six months of his life … I was scared they were going to take him
            away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a
            child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I
            wanted to return him." When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve,
            he stated that he was already aware,[14] and later said he had been
            deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Many years later,
            Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that "he felt he had been really
            blessed by having the two of them as parents."[19][page needed] Jobs
            would "bristle" when Paul and Clara were referred to as his
            “adoptive parents”, and he regarded them as his parents “1,000%”.
            Jobs referred to his biological parents as "my sperm and egg bank.
            That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing,
            nothing more."

                I liked electronics… then I read something that one of my
                heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of
                people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and
                sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do.

            Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a
            machinist,[21] several other jobs,[22] and then "back to work as a
            machinist".

            Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957[23] and by
            1959 the family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain
            View, California.[24] Paul built a workbench in his garage for his
            son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics”. Jobs, meanwhile,
            admired his father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to build
            anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built
            our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him … I wasn't
            that into fixing cars … but I was eager to hang out with my
            dad."[25] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in
            electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the
            neighborhood.[26][page needed] He had difficulty making friends with
            children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a
            "loner".

                Childhood family home of Steve Jobs on Crist Drive in Los Altos,
                California, and the original site of Apple Computer. The home
                was added to a list of historic Los Altos sites in 2013.

            Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended
            to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved, and was
            suspended a few times. Clara had taught him to read as a toddler,
            and Jobs stated that he was "pretty bored in school and [had] turned
            into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade,
            we basically destroyed the teacher."[26][page needed] He frequently
            played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain
            View. His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded
            him, however, and instead blamed the school for not challenging his
            brilliant son

            Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene "Teddy"
            Hill, with turning him around: "She taught an advanced fourth grade
            class, and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation. She
            bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish
            this workbook. I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' That
            really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more
            that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They
            wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight
            to junior high to learn a foreign language, but my parents very
            wisely wouldn't let it happen." Jobs skipped the 5th grade and
            transferred to the 6th grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain
            View[26][page needed] where he became a "socially awkward
            loner".[29] Jobs was often "bullied" at Crittenden Middle, and in
            the middle of 7th grade, he gave his parents an ultimatum: either
            they would take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of
            school.

            Though the Jobs family was not affluent and used all savings in 1967
            to buy a new home, allowing Jobs to change schools.[26][page needed]
            The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos,
            California) was in the better Cupertino School District, Cupertino,
            California,[31] and was embedded in an environment even more heavily
            populated with engineering families than the Mountain View area
            was.[26][page needed] The house was declared a historic site in
            2013, as the first site of Apple Computer.[27] As of 2013, it was
            owned by Jobs's sister, Patty, and occupied by his stepmother,
            Marilyn.[32]

            When he was 13, in 1968, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett
            (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for
            an electronics project.
